My name is Raul, the Head of App Engineering at [Colony](https://colony.io)

I work on the _Dapp_ team, heading up the software architecture efforts of the platform. During my time here, we've solved numerous challenges arising from scaling a decentralized application.

Currently we are hard at work on the [Colony Platform](https://app.colony.io/), which is now in closed beta.
